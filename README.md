# Topic 1: Differences Between Interfaces and Types in TypeScript.

When working with TypeScript, We can define the shape of our data with `interface` and `type`. There are some key differences of those two and both of them have their own uniqueness.

---

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Handling data types
When it comes to handling primitive data types, `type` is always there. Whereas `interface` can shape non primitive data types very nicely.

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Extending and Merging
Interfaces support declaration merging, where multiple interfaces with the same name are merged into a single interface. Types do not support this.

with the help of `interface` we can use extends keyword. while types use intersection types (&)

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Errror messages
Interfaces can provide more descriptive error messages in some cases, particularly when dealing with object shapes.


### âœ… Interface Supports Declaration Merging

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}

const user: User = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
};
